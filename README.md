# Digital-Lock-System-Verilog
<p>In this project, we designed and implemented a Digital Lock System using a 
CPLD board and Verilog HDL. The system was developed by writing Verilog 
code and simulating it using Quartus software. The core functionality of the 
lock involved password verification: a green LED indicates correct password 
entry, a red LED signals an incorrect password, and after three consecutive 
wrong attempts, a yellow LED turns on to represent an error state, during 
which inputs are ignored for 10 seconds. We built the hardware 
connections on a breadboard interfaced with the CPLD. This sequential 
system successfully demonstrates password-based access control with error 
handling, concluding that CPLD-based designs can effectively implement 
reliable digital security mechanisms. </p>
